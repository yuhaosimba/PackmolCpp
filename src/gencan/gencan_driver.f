C
C     In evalhd subroutine, the information about the matrix H must be 
C     passed by means of common declarations. This subroutine must be 
C     coded by the user, taking into account that only nind components 
C     of d are nonnull and that ind is the set of indices of those 
C     components. In other words, the user must write evalhd in such a 
C     way that hd is the vector whose i-th entry is
C 
C               hd(i) = \Sum_{j=1}^{nind} H_{i,ind(j)} d_ind(j)
C
C     Moreover, the only components of hd that must be computed are 
C     those which correspond to the indices ind(1),...,ind(nind). 
C     However, observe that it must be assumed that, in d, the whole 
C     dense vector is present, with its n components, even the null 
C     ones. So, if the user decides to code evalhd without taking into 
C     account the presence of ind and nind, it can be easily done. A 
C     final observation: probably, if nind is close to n, it is not 
C     worthwhile to use ind, due to the cost of accessing the correct 
C     indices. 
C
C     Example: Assume that H is dense. The main steps of evalhd could 
C     be:
C
C          do i = 1,nind
C              indi     = ind(i)
C              hd(indi) = 0.0d0
C              do j = 1,nind
C                  indj     = ind(j)
C                  hd(indi) = hd(indi) + H(indi,indj) * d(indj)

C
C     cggpnf   double precision
C              cgscre means conjugate gradient stopping criterion 
C              relation, and cggpnf means Conjugate Gradients projected 
C              gradient final norm. Both are related to a stopping 
C              criterion of Conjugate Gradients. This stopping criterion 
C              depends on the norm of the residual of the linear system. 
C              The norm of the residual should be less or equal than a 
C              ''small'' quantity which decreases as we are 
C              approximating the solution of the minimization problem 
C              (near the solution, better the truncated-Newton direction 
C              we aim). Then, the log of the required accuracy requested 
C              to Conjugate Gradient has a linear dependence on the log 
C              of the norm of the continuous projected gradient. This 
C              linear relation uses the squared Euclidian norm of the 
C              projected gradient if cgscre is equal to 1 and uses the 
C              sup-norm if cgscre is equal to 2. In addition, the 
C              precision required to CG is equal to cgepsi (conjugate 
C              gradient initial epsilon) at x0 and cgepsf (conjugate 
C              gradient final epsilon) when the Euclidian- or sup-norm 
C              of the projected gradient is equal to cggpnf (conjugate 
C              gradients projected gradient final norm) which is an 
C              estimation of the value of the Euclidian- or sup-norm of 
C              the projected gradient at the solution.
C
C              RECOMMENDED: cgscre = 1, cggpnf = epsgpen; or
C                           cgscre = 2, cggpnf = epsgpsn.

C
C              cgeps varies from cgepsi to cgepsf in a way that depends

C
C              If, in an iteration of CG we find a direction d such that 
C              d^T H d <= 0 then we take the following decision:
C

C              go to the boundary choosing the best point among the two 
C              points at the boundary and the current point. 
C
C              (ii) If nearlyq = FALSE then we stop at the current point.
C
C              Moreover, if the objective function is quadratic more 
c              effort is due in computing the Truncated Newton direction.

C              that case, failure of the line search is declared (may be 
C              the direction is not a descent direction due to an error 
C              in the gradient calculations). Use mininterp greater

C     htvtype  integer

C              set to 0 (ZERO). In this case, the product of the Hessian 
C              times vector d (input argument of evalhd subroutine) must

C
C     inform   integer
C              This output parameter tells what happened in this 
C              subroutine, according to the following conventions:
C 
C              0 = convergence with small Euclidian norm of the 
C                  continuous projected gradient (smaller than epsgpen);
C
C              1 = convergence with small sup-norm of the continuous 
C                  projected gradient (smaller than epsgpsn);
C
C              2 = the algorithm stopped by ''lack of progress'', that 
C                  means that f(xk) - f(x_{k+1}) <= epsnfp * 
C                  max{ f(x_j) - f(x_{j+1}, j < k } during maxitnfp 
C                  consecutive iterations. If desired, set maxitnfp 
C                  equal to maxit to inhibit this stopping criterion.
C
C              3 = the algorithm stopped because the order of the 
C                  Euclidian norm of the continuous projected gradient 
C                  did not change during maxitngp consecutive 
C                  iterations. Probably, we are asking for an 
C                  exaggerated small norm of continuous projected 
C                  gradient for declaring convergence. If desired, set
C                  maxitngp equal to maxit to inhibit this stopping 
C                  criterion.
C
C              4 = the algorithm stopped because the functional value 
c                  is very small (smaller than fmin). If desired, set 
C                  fmin equal to minus infabs to inhibit this stopping 
C                  criterion.
C
C              6 = too small step in a line search. After having made at 
C                  least mininterp interpolations, the steplength 
C                  becames small. ''small steplength'' means that we are 
C                  at point x with direction d and step alpha, and 
C
C                  alpha * ||d||_infty < max( epsabs, epsrel * 
C                  ||x||_infty ). 
C 
C                  In that case failure of the line search is declared 
C                  (may be the direction is not a descent direction due 
C                  to an error in the gradient calculations). If 
C                  desired, set mininterp equal to maxfc to inhibit this 
C                  stopping criterion.
C
C              7 = it was achieved the maximum allowed number of 
C                  iterations (maxit);
C
C              8 = it was achieved the maximum allowed number of 
C                  function evaluations (maxfc);
C
C            < 0 = error in evalal, evalnal or evalhd subroutines.
